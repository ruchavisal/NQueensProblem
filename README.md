# NQueens problem using Genetic Algorithm

## Problem Statement 
The N-queens problem is a typical programming problem in which we must find a solution to placing ‘n’ queens on ‘n*n’ board such that no two queens can attack each other. Attack means that no 2 queens can be placed in the same row, same column, or same diagonal. Though it seems to be a trivial problem, a wide range of programming algorithms can be applied to solve this. Here I have implemented Genetic Search Algorithm to solve the n-queens problem. 

## Instructions to execute the code:
### Prerequisites:
* Make sure you have python installed.
* Make sure you have numpy installed.
* When you import the code in an IDE make sure there are no errors on the imports (randint and randrange from random).


### Steps to run the program:
* Clone the repository.
* Go to the folder containing the code.
* Open the terminal and and run command- py NQUEEN.py
* Enter the number of queens.
